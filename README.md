## Welcome to the Recursive-Review repository!

Most of the content in this repo is currently in the wiki. Find it here: https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/recursive-review/wiki

This repo exists to support an accelerated learning process known as **"non-linear"**. Non-linear involves circling back. in algorithmic terms, that maps to recursive processing in general. The idea is to tackle massively complex projects by just jumping into the deep end first! Don't bother learning all the prerequisite skills first. Just get started with project intention. If you are lacking something technical to understand how to implement the project, circle back and get it. Turn prerequisites into "post" requisites or better yet - "on demand" requisites. If you need something, go get it! But don't let the project wait until you have learned everything there is to learn first. Do first - then learn. The learning is in the doing.

## Theory Behind Non-Linear Learning

The phrase **non-linear learning** summarizes a great mass of social theory, world history, philosophy, and scientific research. Students and instructors who just want to put the model to work should jump straight to the [wiki](https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/recursive-review/wiki) and work through all the content there. This current section is a meta-commmentary on the question of "why non-linear"? Here will be disclosed a sampling of the many philosophical and scientific sources lying beneath the model itself. 

### Recursive Relevance Realization

A very direct inspiration for the notion of recursive, non-linear learning is the work of cognitive theorist [John Vervaeke](https://johnvervaeke.com/). One of Vervaeke's core ideas most directly supportive of non-linear learning is his notion of **Recursive Revelance Realization (3R)**. 3R combines with another of Vervaeke's ideas that knowledge itself can be understood as **propositional, procedural, perspectival, and participatory (4P)**. The resulting system then is [**4P/3R**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/202101/john-vervaeke-s-brilliant-4p3r-metatheory-cognition)

Conventional computer science education (linear coursework) leans heavilty into the propositional (factual knowledge) and the procedural (step-by-step learning on core technologies). All of that is very necessary. But it may lack perspectival context ("why do we have to learn this?)" and most critically, the particpatory dimension vital for true understanding. "Participatory" means jumping right in and swimming in deeper waters! The non-linear learning model presented here is really an adaptation of Vervaeke's participatory, applied to the particular discipline of computer science. 

### Cynefin and the Chaotic

Another inspiration behind non-linear learning is the work of [**Cynefin**](https://www.complexsystemsframeworks.ca/framework/cynefin/) founder Dave Snowden on how to navigate the domains of the **complex** and the **chaotic**.  Linear methods generally work well for the **simple** and the **complicated**. But chaos and complexity require more. In particular, they require a direct **action learning** approach, such as represented in the model presented here. 

### bel hooks ###

The research program that brought me eventually to non-linear learning was catalyzed in 2022 by a reading of bel hooks, *Teaching to Transgress*. Selected quotes from that book below all shed light on essential impulses underlying non-linear learning.

"When education is the practice of freedom, students are not the only ones asked to share, to confess." *Teaching to Transgress*, p 21.

"Attending school then was sheer joy. I loved being a student. I loved learning." *Teaching to Transgress*, p 3.

"Urging all of us to open our minds and hearts so that we can grow know beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable, so that we can think and rethink ... a movement against and beyond boundaries" *Teaching to Transgress*, p 12.

"It is as though immersed in a project I lose all sense of myself and must then, when the work is done, rediscover who I am and where I am going." *Teaching to Transgress*, p 23.

"We live in chaos, uncertain about the possibility of building and sustaining community." *Teaching to Transgress*, p 27.

"I believe that combining the analytical and experiential is a richer way of knowing." *Teaching to Transgress*, p 89.

"We are all subjects in history. We must return ourselves to a state of embodiment ... " *Teaching to Transgress*, p 89.

### Paulo Freire ###

Paulo Freire is a direct influence on both Dave Snowden and bel hooks. Also on me - I first encountered Freire's *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* in graduate school in the early 1980s. Many misinterpret Freire as a Marxist ideologue trying to talk the peasants into canned notions of revolution. A closer reading of the book reveals essentially the opposite - Freire focuses on agency, self-directed learning, and dignity for his marginalized adult students. Freire's literacy training for campesinos was indeed a political act - Brazil (like the US for many years) - had a literacy requirement for voting rights. So the act of teaching reading was also an act of political mobilization. But Freire had nothing but distain for the doctrinaire upper-class Marxists who wanted campesinos for some revolutionary model directed from the top. To Freire, such people were essentially like the Who lyric "meet the new boss, same as the old boss". 

### Peter Pogany and the Chaotic Transition ###

With respect to political economic systems, I generally agree with John Fullerton that "neither the current form of capitalism nor the current form of socicalism is a sustainable system". (Fullerton, *Regenerative Economics*, 2025, p. 39). Left-right arguments about who gets the spoils of industrial growth are largely beside the point for much of what matters today. Searching for a model that would allow for constructive action even in the face of current systemic collapse and chaos, the work of Peter Pogany came to my attention: 

https://integralpermaculture.wordpress.com/peter-pogany/

Pogany's model is grounded in systems theory, evolutionary thermodyamics, and the Gaian big picture in relation to how geopolitics interacts with the biosphere. Let's just say that Mother Earth cannot be disenfranchised! Pogany's recommendation for the coming Global System 3 (which he will not see, having passed in 2014) is global cooperation and collaboration adjusted to our biospheric production capacites. That's the macro framing all the micro action models in the [wiki](https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/recursive-review/wiki) are pointing towards. (Others may view the macro differently, but I won't pretend that mine is a purely theoritical "view from nowhere". Nor will I pretend that I don't have view.) 

### Summary ###

Although Friere's term "pedagogy of the oppressed" is certainly inspirational, it feels like an artifact of a bygone era. bel hooks's education as "the practice of freedom" is closer to the current mark, but again feels a bit last century. Non-linear needs a language of its own. Reflecting upon the advent of agentic AI, I am struck that agentic AI can only truly be managed by agentic humans. All of the nightmare scenarios about AI exterminating humans assume we humans allow ourselves to become passive consumers whatever the attention economy is offering us on screens from moment to moment. Any number of spiritual and psychological practices, however, point out that beneath **attention** lies **intention**. It's possible to detach from mindless stimulous-response cycles! The silver lining in Pogany's "chaotic transition" is that in such eras, the stimulous-response cycles of the now-defunct previous global system fail to pay off as expected, essentially forcing people to think for themselves. The proximate cause of this development of a non-linear educuation model is the reality that the entry level job market is seizing up and students who would have been considered highly qualified a decade ago are finding very limited opportunities in the AI transition economy. Pogany saw that coming a decade ago. Snowden shows us how to navigate it. Vervaeke suggests how to make sense of it all. I'm wrapping all those together and calling the resulting non-linear bundle **agentic education for the age of agentic AI**.
