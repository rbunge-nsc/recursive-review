### Welcome to the Recursive-Review repository!

Most of the content in this repo is currently in the wiki. Find it here: https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/recursive-review/wiki

This repo exists to support an accelerated learning process known as *"non-linear"*. Non-linear involves circling back. in algorithmic terms, that maps to recursive processing in general. The idea is to tackle massively complex projects by just jumping into the deep end first! Don't bother learning all the prerequisite skills first. Just get started with project intention. If you are lacking something technical to understand how to implement the project, circle back and get it. Turn prerequisites into "post" requisites or better yet - "on demand" requisites. If you need something, go get it! But don't let the project wait until you have learned everything there is to learn first. Do first - then learn. The learning is in the doing.
