## Welcome to the Recursive-Review repository!

Most of the content in this repo is currently in the wiki. Find it here: https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/recursive-review/wiki

This repo exists to support an accelerated learning process known as **"non-linear"**. Non-linear involves circling back. in algorithmic terms, that maps to recursive processing in general. The idea is to tackle massively complex projects by just jumping into the deep end first! Don't bother learning all the prerequisite skills first. Just get started with project intention. If you are lacking something technical to understand how to implement the project, circle back and get it. Turn prerequisites into "post" requisites or better yet - "on demand" requisites. If you need something, go get it! But don't let the project wait until you have learned everything there is to learn first. Do first - then learn. The learning is in the doing.

## Theory Behind Non-Linear Learning

The phrase **non-linear learning** summarizes a great mass of social theory, world history, philosophy, and scientific research. Students and instructors who just want to put the model to work should jump straight to the [wiki](https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/recursive-review/wiki) and work through all the content there. This current section is a meta-commmentary on the question of "why non-linear"? Here will be disclosed a sampling of the many philosophical and scientific sources lying beneath the model itself. 

### Recursive Relevance Realization

A very direct inspiration for the notion of recursive, non-linear learning is the work of cognitive theorist [John Vervaeke](https://johnvervaeke.com/). One of Vervaeke's core ideas most directly supportive of non-linear learning is his notion of **Recursive Revelance Realization (3R)**. 3R combines with another of Vervaeke's ideas that knowledge itself can be understood as **propositional, procedural, perspectival, and participatory (4P)**. The resulting system then is [**4P/3R**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/202101/john-vervaeke-s-brilliant-4p3r-metatheory-cognition)

Conventional Computer Science education (linear coursework) leans heavilty into the propositional (factual knowledge) and the procedural (step-by-step learning on core technologies). All of that is very necessary. But it may lack perspectival context ("why do we have to learn this?)" and most critically, the particpatory dimension vital for true understanding. "Participatory" means jumping right in and swimming in deeper waters! The non-linear learning model presented here is really an adaptation of Vervaeke's participatory, applied to the particular discipline of computer science. 

### Cynefin and the Chaotic

Another inspiration behind non-linear learning is the work of [**Cynefin**](https://www.complexsystemsframeworks.ca/framework/cynefin/) founder Dave Snowden on how to navigate the domains of the **complex** and the **chaotic**.  Linear methods generally work well for the **simple** and the **complicated**. But chaos and complexity require more. In particular, they require a direct **action learning** approach, such us represented in the model presented here.
